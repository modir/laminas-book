# laminas-book

This is a "migration" of the Zend Framework 3 book by Oleg Krivtsov to the Laminas framework.

## Technical Information

The whole documentation is now generated with https://www.mkdocs.org/

The whole configuration is in mkdocs.yml.

If you want to make bigger changes and test everything first locally then I recommend you to go through the Getting Started
guide at https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/ first.

## Status

The book was in a first stage just copied and then with search/replace reworded from Zend to Laminas.
I found then several issues with the tables as Oleg used his own modfied Markdown interpreter to generate the HTML files.
I tried to resolve as many problems as I could find but there are still some. Furthermore many images are outdated
and should be updated as well. Everyone is welcome to make merge requests.

In the first step I would like to resolve as many problems as possible. In the next step I would like to modernize the code
and make everything type safe as it should be these days with PHP 8.x.

I welcome everyone to give feedback about the book. Helping hands are welcome.
